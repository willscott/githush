there are classes of github events / notifications that aren't high value
but are hard to not-watch.
In particular if an issue is closed, or PR already merged it is typically less
relevant - especially since the artifact of the action may well take the form of
an email recording the event as well.

this script can run in the background to clean up no-longer-relevant events
from github notifications to keep them a bit less redundant.

Usage
---
Credentials: make a file named "auth.json" containing access credentials.
The easiest way to do this is create a "personal access token" in the github
ux, with permissions for "Repo" and "Notifications". Put the quoted string
(e.g. the valid json form of it) in the file "auth.json".

Running: `npm install && node index.js`
